## COST BREAKDOWN: What You Actually Pay

**Year 1 (Typical Investment)**
```
Software subscription:        $60,000    ($50/user/month × 20 users)
Implementation/setup:         $20,000    (configuration, integration)
Training:                     $5,000     (vendor + staff time)
Your staff setup time:        $15,000    (300 hours × $50/hour)
TOTAL YEAR 1:                $100,000
```

**Years 2-3 (Ongoing)**
```
Software subscription:        $60,000/year
Admin/maintenance:            $2,500/year
TOTAL YEARS 2-3:             $125,000
```

**3-Year Total Cost: $225,000**

## CALCULATING YOUR ROI: Simple Formula

**Step 1: Estimate time savings**
- Current hours/week on repetitive task: ___
- Number of people doing this: ___
- Expected AI efficiency: 50-70% (conservative)
- **Total annual hours saved**: Hours × People × 52 weeks × Efficiency

**Step 2: Value that time**
- Fully-loaded hourly cost: $45-75/hour (government average: $50/hour)
- **Annual benefit**: Hours saved × Hourly cost

**Step 3: Calculate 3-year ROI**
- 3-year benefits: Annual benefit × 3 × 0.8 (learning curve adjustment)
- 3-year costs: ~$225K (varies with team size)
- **ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%**

**Example:**
```
- 10 staff × 10 hours/week × 50% savings = 2,600 hours/year
- 2,600 hours × $50/hour = $130,000/year
- 3-year benefits: $130K × 3 × 0.8 = $312,000
- 3-year costs: $225,000
- ROI = ($312K - $225K) / $225K = 39% (still positive!)
```

## CONSERVATIVE VS. OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES

| Scenario | Time Savings | Annual Benefit | 3-Year ROI | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** | 50-60% | Lower | 200-350% | Low |
| **Realistic** | 60-75% | Medium | 350-550% | Medium |
| **Optimistic** | 80%+ | Higher | 600%+ | Higher |

**Recommendation for Business Case:** Use conservative estimate (50-60%). Actual results typically exceed projections.

## HIDDEN BENEFITS (Hard to Quantify but Valuable)

✓ **Quality improvements**: Fewer errors, more consistent output
✓ **Staff satisfaction**: Less tedious work, more meaningful tasks
✓ **Capacity growth**: Handle more work without hiring
✓ **Speed**: Faster response times to citizens
✓ **Data-driven decisions**: More analysis gets done
✓ **Risk reduction**: Better audit trails, compliance

These benefits often equal 20-50% of time-savings value but hard to forecast precisely.

## PAYBACK PERIOD TIMELINE

| Month | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Investment** | $100K | $30K | $30K | $160K |
| **Savings** | $52K* | $130K | $130K | $312K |
| **Net** | -$48K | +$100K | +$100K | +$152K |
| **Cumulative** | -$48K | +$52K | +$152K | +$152K |

*Year 1 savings reduced 62.5% due to learning curve

**Break-Even:** Month 5-7 (depending on use case)

## COMMON ROI QUESTIONS

**Q: How do you measure actual time savings?**
A: Survey users ("Does AI save time?" yes/no), time tracking tools, workflow metrics, or sample workflow measurements.

**Q: What if our agency is less efficient initially?**
A: Account for learning curve. Recommend 62.5% of full benefit in Year 1, 100% in Year 2+.

**Q: Can we get higher ROI?**
A: Yes! Better use cases, higher time savings, or reduced costs increases ROI. Use optimistic scenario for upside potential.

**Q: What if we get lower time savings?**
A: Even 30% time savings often positive ROI given low cost of AI ($20-50/person/month vs. $5,000/month labor).

**Q: What about free/low-cost tools?**
A: Free tools often give 80%+ ROI, but usually have limitations (usage caps, older models, security concerns for government).

## QUICK ROI CALCULATOR

**Your numbers:**
```
Target workflow:              ___________________
Current hours/week:           _____ hours
Number of staff:              _____ people
Hourly cost (loaded):         $_____ /hour

Calculations:
Annual hours: _____ × _____ × 52 = _____
Time savings (60%):           _____ × 0.60 = _____ hours/year
Annual benefit:               _____ × $_____ = $_____
3-year benefit (0.8 factor):  $_____ × 3 × 0.8 = $_____
3-year cost estimate:         ~$225,000
ROI = ($_____  - $225K) / $225K = _____%
```

## ROI FOR DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT SECTORS

**Federal Agencies**
- ROI tends higher (larger scale)
- Typical: 400-550%
- Compliance costs may reduce ROI slightly

**State/Local Government**
- ROI typically 300-450%
- Smaller scale may reduce raw numbers
- Per-person savings often higher (proportionally)

**Public Health**
- ROI typically 300-400%
- High value from surveillance, reporting automation
- Compliance (HIPAA) adds cost but justified

**Law Enforcement**
- ROI typically 250-350%
- Compliance (CJIS) adds cost (~20-30%)
- Value from case management, reporting

---

## FUNDING OPTIONS

**Option 1: Software Procurement**
- Budget $30-50/user/month in ongoing costs
- Modest upfront (training, setup)
- Works for <100 users

**Option 2: Agency/Grant Funding**
- Apply for innovation/modernization grants
- Many government technology funds available
- Often cover pilot projects (3-12 months)

**Option 3: Cost-Sharing Model**
- Start with free/pilot phase
- Prove ROI first
- Expand with budget justification

**Option 4: Efficiency Savings Reinvestment**
- Use time savings to fund expansion
- Self-sustaining model
- Good for scaling across agency
