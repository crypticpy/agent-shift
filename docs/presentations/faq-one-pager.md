# FAQ One-Pager: 10 Most Common Questions

**Quick answers to questions you'll get after the presentation**

---

## 1. What exactly is agentic AI?

**Simple Answer:** AI agents are smart software that can understand instructions and complete tasks without being told exactly how to do them every time.

**Real Example:**
- Old way: "Move this data from column A to B, then calculate sum, then format as table"
- AI agent way: "Analyze this data and prepare a summary report"

**Why it matters:** AI agents adapt to variations, handle unexpected situations, and learn from feedback like a good employee would.

---

## 2. What's the realistic ROI for government?

**Short Answer:** 300-500% typical over 3 years, with 5-10 month break-even.

**Example:** 20 people spending 10 hours/week on reports
- Investment: $180,000 (3 years)
- Time saved: $983,000 (valued at $50/hour)
- Adjusted for learning curve: $700,000 benefit
- **ROI: 289% → Net gain of $520,000**

**Key point:** Even conservative estimates show strong positive ROI. Even if we're 50% wrong, it's still worth doing.

---

## 3. How long does implementation really take?

**Realistic Timeline:**
- **Pilot:** 8-12 weeks (test with small group, measure results)
- **Full deployment:** 12-16 weeks (train users, rollout, optimize)
- **Total:** 4-6 months from decision to full production

**Faster options:**
- Chatbots: 4-8 weeks (less integration complexity)
- Simple automation: 2-4 weeks (document summarization, etc.)

**Slower options:**
- Case management systems: 12-20 weeks (complex integration)
- Mission-critical systems: 6-12 months (extensive testing)

---

## 4. What compliance certifications do I really need?

**Quick decision tree:**
- **Federal agency?** → FedRAMP (35 certified tools available)
- **Health/public health?** → HIPAA (28 tools available)
- **Law enforcement?** → CJIS (18 tools available)
- **State/local general use?** → SOC 2 Type II (95+ tools available)

**Key point:** Don't use free consumer AI (ChatGPT free, etc.) with government data. Enterprise versions or government-certified tools required.

**See:** Compliance Quick Guide handout for full decision tree

---

## 5. Can we start with a free/cheap trial?

**Good News:** Yes! Most tools offer free trials.

**For Pilots:** Use free trials during evaluation (8-12 weeks)
- ChatGPT free, Claude free, Google Gemini free all acceptable for non-sensitive pilot testing
- Verify compliance for production use

**For Production:** Upgrade to paid/compliant versions for real government data
- Monthly cost: $20-50/person/month for most government use
- Compliance certified tools: $30-100/person/month
- Total team cost: Usually $2,000-5,000/month for 50-100 users

**Bottom line:** Free trials for pilots. Paid certified tools for production.

---

## 6. Will this replace jobs?

**Data Says:** No. Agencies using AI are hiring, not firing.

**What Actually Happens:**
- **Old:** 70% of time on tedious tasks, 30% on analysis
- **New:** 30% checking AI output, 70% on deeper analysis and strategy

**New Jobs Created:**
- AI prompt engineers (how to give good instructions)
- AI quality reviewers (verifying AI outputs)
- Workflow designers (building AI-human workflows)
- AI trainers (teaching domain-specific knowledge)

**Bottom line:** Jobs are transformed, not eliminated. Staff focus on higher-value work.

---

## 7. Is my data secure with AI?

**If you use the right tool:** Yes, absolutely.

**Security depends on tool choice:**
- ✅ Enterprise ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot → Excellent (SOC 2, FedRAMP options)
- ✅ Government-certified tools → Excellent (meet compliance requirements)
- ❌ Free consumer tools with sensitive data → Risk

**Key protections:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
- Access controls (role-based, MFA)
- Audit logging (track who accessed what)
- Business Associate Agreement (HIPAA) or CJIS Addendum (law enforcement)

**Best practice:** Use enterprise versions for government data. Require compliance certification.

---

## 8. What if the AI makes mistakes?

**Reality:** AI can and will make mistakes.

**Your protection: Human-in-the-loop**
- AI generates draft → Human reviews and approves
- Works like working with a smart intern (capable but requires oversight)
- Typical error rates: 85-95% accuracy (requires 5-15% human review)

**Error types to watch for:**
- Hallucinations (making up facts)
- Outdated information (training data cutoff)
- Bias (reflecting training data bias)
- Misunderstanding context (getting instructions wrong)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Human review for important decisions
- Fact-checking for public-facing outputs
- Quality assurance processes
- Continuous monitoring and feedback

**Bottom line:** Build human verification into every workflow.

---

## 9. How much will this actually cost?

**Software:** $20-100/person/month
- Free tier: Free but limited
- Basic: $20-40/person/month
- Professional: $50-80/person/month
- Enterprise: $80-100+/person/month

**Other costs (one-time):**
- Implementation: $5,000-25,000
- Training: $2,000-5,000
- Compliance/legal: $1,000-5,000

**Total cost for 50-person team, Year 1:** ~$40,000-70,000
**Total cost for 50-person team, Years 2-3:** ~$12,000-24,000/year

**ROI:** Typical break-even in 5-10 months, positive ROI from there.

**Budget tip:** Start small (10-20 person pilot), expand based on results.

## 10. Where do we actually start?

**Action plan (next 30 days):**

**Week 1:**
- Identify your biggest pain (most time-consuming task)
- Determine compliance needs (federal? health? law enforcement?)
- Form implementation team (you, IT, security, legal)

**Week 2:**
- Browse Agent Shift Catalog (agent-shift.vercel.app)
- Filter by use case and compliance
- Identify 2-3 finalist tools
- Request free trials

**Week 3:**
- Test tools with sample data
- Get IT/security approval
- Make pilot tool selection

**Week 4:**
- Select 10-15 pilot volunteers
- Schedule 2-hour training
- Launch 8-week pilot

**By Month 2:**
- Measure time savings and satisfaction
- Calculate actual ROI
- Decide: expand, refine, or pivot
