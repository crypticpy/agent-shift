## Understanding Agentic AI

### What is an AI Agent?

**Simple Definition:**
An AI agent is software that can understand your goals, make decisions, and take actions to accomplish tasks—with minimal ongoing input from you.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Autonomous** - Works independently once given a goal
2. **Adaptive** - Adjusts approach based on results
3. **Goal-oriented** - Focuses on outcomes, not just steps
4. **Conversational** - Interacts in natural language

**Contrast with Traditional Software:**
- **Traditional software**: You click buttons and follow menus
- **AI agent**: You have a conversation about what you need

### How AI Agents Work

**The Conversation Loop:**
```
1. You: State your goal in natural language
   Example: "Analyze last month's disease surveillance data and identify any concerning trends"

2. Agent: Asks clarifying questions (if needed)
   Example: "Should I compare against the same month last year or the previous month?"

3. You: Provide guidance
   Example: "Compare against both and highlight anything unusual"

4. Agent: Executes the work
   - Fetches the data
   - Performs analysis
   - Identifies patterns
   - Generates visualizations

5. Agent: Returns results for your review
   Example: "I found a 35% increase in flu cases in the northwest quadrant compared to last year..."

6. You: Review, refine, or approve
   Example: "Good. Now draft a brief for the health director."

7. Agent: Continues execution based on feedback
```

### Types of AI Agents

**1. Task Automation Agents**
- Execute specific tasks (e.g., data entry, scheduling)
- Follow defined workflows
- High accuracy on repetitive work
- **Example**: Automatically filing documents, sending reminders

**2. Research & Analysis Agents**
- Gather information from multiple sources
- Synthesize findings
- Generate summaries and insights
- **Example**: Literature review, policy research, competitive analysis

**3. Content Creation Agents**
- Draft documents, reports, emails
- Generate visualizations and presentations
- Adapt tone and format to context
- **Example**: Report writing, grant proposals, citizen communications

**4. Decision Support Agents**
- Analyze data and identify options
- Model scenarios and outcomes
- Recommend actions with rationale
- **Example**: Resource allocation, risk assessment, strategic planning

**5. Orchestration Agents**
- Coordinate multiple other agents
- Manage complex multi-step workflows
- Handle dependencies and errors
- **Example**: End-to-end grant application process, emergency response coordination

### What AI Agents Can and Cannot Do

**✅ AI Agents Excel At:**
- Processing large volumes of data quickly
- Identifying patterns and anomalies
- Generating draft content (reports, emails, presentations)
- Performing repetitive tasks consistently
- Searching and synthesizing information
- Automating multi-step workflows

**❌ AI Agents Struggle With:**
- Truly novel creative work (they remix existing patterns)
- Decisions requiring ethical judgment or lived experience
- Tasks requiring physical interaction (though this is changing)
- Understanding nuanced interpersonal dynamics
- Work requiring deep domain expertise (they supplement, not replace experts)

**🤝 Best Results Come From:**
- AI handling execution, humans providing oversight
- Clear goals and success criteria from humans
- Human review and refinement of AI output
- Iterative feedback loops
- Combining AI speed with human judgment

- 10 minutes for initial setup

**Steps:**
1. Connect AI tool to your email (following tool's instructions)
2. Create a prompt template:
   ```
   Summarize my emails from the last 12 hours. Organize into:
   - Urgent (requires immediate action)
   - Important (action needed this week)
   - FYI (informational only)
   - Low priority (can wait or delegate)

   For each category, list sender, subject, and 1-sentence summary.
   Highlight any deadlines or action items.
   ```
3. Set up automation (if available) or run manually each morning
4. Review summary (2-3 minutes)
5. Triage your day based on summary

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 20-30 minutes sorting through 50-100 emails
- After: 2-3 minutes reviewing summary
- **Savings: 15-25 minutes per day = 1.25-2 hours per week**

**Tips:**
- Start with a 24-hour summary, adjust timeframe as needed
- Customize categories to match your work priorities
- Use the summary to delegate or defer low-priority items
- Review accuracy for first week, then trust the system

4. **Share successes** - Show real results from pilot projects
5. **Offer ongoing support** - Office hours, documentation, peer mentoring
6. **Iterate based on feedback** - Adjust based on what works

**Q: What if staff resist using AI agents?**
**A:** Common concerns and responses:
- **"It will replace me"** → Focus on augmentation, not replacement
- **"I don't trust it"** → Start with human-in-the-loop, build trust gradually
- **"It's too complicated"** → Begin with very simple workflows
- **"We've always done it this way"** → Show time savings and reduced burnout
