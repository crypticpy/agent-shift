# Before & After Examples: Government Documentation Enhancements

This document shows concrete examples of how generic statements have been transformed into credible, metric-backed evidence.

---

## Example 1: Disease Surveillance Use Case

### BEFORE (Generic)
```
**Problem**: Manual disease surveillance processes are slow, labor-intensive,
and often miss early outbreak signals.

**Solution**: Deploy AI agents for automated data collection, pattern
recognition, and alert generation.

**Results**:
- Faster outbreak detection
- Improved accuracy
- Time savings
- ROI: 420% over 3 years
```

**Issues**:
- No specific organization context
- Vague "faster" and "improved" metrics
- No implementation details
- Reader left wondering: "How much faster? For whom? How much does it cost?"

---

### AFTER (Specific & Credible)
```
**Typical Implementation Profile**:
