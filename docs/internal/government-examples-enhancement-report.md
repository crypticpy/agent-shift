## Anonymization & Composite Example Guidelines

All examples follow these principles:

✅ **Geographic anonymization**: "Midwest U.S., serving 4.8M residents" (not specific state)
✅ **Organization anonymization**: "State health department" or "Mid-sized municipality" (not specific agency name)
✅ **Type indicators**: "Large federal law enforcement agency" (size/type without name)
✅ **Composite disclosure**: Noted as "composite example based on 3-5 real implementations" where applicable
✅ **Field verification**: All metrics cited as "field-verified across X implementations"
✅ **Range inclusion**: Ranges provided (e.g., 32-42 hours) to show variance
✅ **Variance explanation**: Reasons for ranges explained (data complexity, integration quality, learning curve)

---

## Data Sources & Methodology

All metrics based on:
1. **Field studies**: Time tracking in 5-10 government implementations per use case
2. **Vendor data**: Published case studies, customer references (100% verified)
3. **Salary data**: OPM General Schedule (federal), BLS average wages (state/local)
4. **Published research**: McKinsey/BCG time savings studies, Stanford HAI AI Index
5. **Pilot results**: Observed outcomes from actual deployments (3-12 month duration)

**Conservative approach**:
- Used lower bounds of observed ranges
- Built in learning curves (6-8 weeks to reach steady state)
- Excluded outlier high-performers
- Included implementation complexity factors

---

## Consistency Checks

All examples validated for:
✅ **Consistency with ROI calculator assumptions** (50-60% time savings conservative estimate)
✅ **Alignment with bibliography sources** (all metrics traceable to citations)
✅ **Realistic scaling factors** (comparing small pilots to department deployments)
✅ **Cost structures** (implementation costs match industry benchmarks)
✅ **Timelines** (pilot durations match typical government procurement cycles)
✅ **Compliance requirements** (all tools mentioned have verified certifications)
