MCP servers act as bridges between AI agents and your data sources.\n\n**What it is:** Your AI agent talks to an MCP server (instead of directly to your data). The MCP server handles authentication, data retrieval, and formatting. This creates a standard interface for agents to access many data sources.\n\n**Example:** An MCP server for Gmail gives any MCP-compatible agent (Claude, GPT, etc.) the ability to read/send emails through a standard protocol.\n\n**Look for:** Tools that support MCP or advertise 'context protocol' compatibility. This is cutting-edge (2024-2025) but growing fast."
