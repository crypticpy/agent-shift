        "You become the most important link in the chain. Not because you're doing everything, but because you're orchestrating everything. The AI agents are powerful, but without your direction, judgment, and human insight, they're just tools. You're the conductor of the orchestra."

An agent can do it tonight. That community engagement initiative that seemed too resource-intensive? Now it's possible.",
