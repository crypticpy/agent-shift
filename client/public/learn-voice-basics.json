        "Typing is slow. Your brain thinks faster than your fingers can move. When you talk to AI, you unlock a more natural way to work. You can explain complex ideas while walking, driving, or doing other tasks. Voice lets you multitask in ways typing never could.",
        "Research backs this up: A Stanford University study found that speech is **3x faster** than typing on mobile devices (150 words per minute vs 40 WPM), with a **20% lower error rate**. You can dictate a 500-word email in 3 minutes. Typing that same email might take 12-15 minutes."

        "**Speed:** Average speaking speed is 150-180 words per minute ([National Center for Voice and Speech](https://virtualspeech.com/blog/average-speaking-rate-words-per-minute)), while average typing speed is only 38-40 WPM. Professional typists reach 65-75 WPM—still slower than casual speech. [Stanford research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07323) found voice input is 3× faster than mobile typing (Ruan et al., 2016).",
        "**Multitasking:** Voice interfaces enable hands-free operation, allowing you to work while your hands and eyes are occupied with other activities. [Healthcare studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815406/) show hands-free communication tools reduce communication time by 25% (Vandenkerkhof et al., 2009) and [51% of physicians report time savings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10035815/) with voice recognition technology.",
        "**Cognitive Load:** Voice typing reduces mental overhead by enabling natural thought expression. [Research shows](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2207676.2208386) voice input results in 29% fewer user corrections and lower cognitive demand compared to traditional dictation (Kumar et al., CHI 2012). Speaking is less cognitively demanding than typing, as writing requires sustained attention, planning, and motor execution.",
        "**Accuracy:** Modern speech recognition (2016 onwards) achieves [20% lower error rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07323) than mobile typing for English, and up to 63% lower for Mandarin (Stanford, Ruan et al.). These improvements stem from advances in deep learning and neural networks.",
        "**Additional Research:** [Federal Reserve study (2024)](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/feb/impact-generative-ai-work-productivity) found workers using generative AI save an average of 2.2 hours per week. [Harvard/BCG study (2023)](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700) showed consultants using AI completed tasks 25% faster with 40% higher quality."
