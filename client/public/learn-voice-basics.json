        "Typing is slow. Your brain thinks faster than your fingers can move. When you talk to AI, you unlock a more natural way to work. You can explain complex ideas while walking, driving, or doing other tasks. Voice lets you multitask in ways typing never could.",
        "Research backs this up: A Stanford University study found that speech is **3x faster** than typing on mobile devices (150 words per minute vs 40 WPM), with a **20% lower error rate**. You can dictate a 500-word email in 3 minutes. Typing that same email might take 12-15 minutes."
