        "Agent chaining is when you use the output from one AI agent as the input for another AI agent. It's like an assembly line where each agent does one specific job really well, then passes the work to the next agent.",
        "Think about making a sandwich. You don't do everything at once. First, someone gets the bread. Then someone adds meat. Then someone adds vegetables. Then someone cuts it. Each person (or agent) does one thing well, and together they create something better than any single person could make alone."
